# Jewelry-Price-Optimization
This repository presents the Jewelry Price Optimization project focusing on refining pricing strategies for Gemineye Emporium using machine learning. Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, RAPIDS, and Sci-kit Learn are employed to develop predictive models. The project aims to optimize jewelry prices efficiently. Documentation and reporting are done using R Markdown, and interactive web applications will be built using R Shiny.
